# JFOS (Java Framework Operating Shell)

JFOS is a desktop environment and system shell written in Java, designed to run on top of a Linux kernel.

The goal of JFOS is to create a lightweight, customizable, and fully Java-based interface for interacting with Linux systems. It features a custom window manager, a start menu, taskbar, file access, and system control â€” all developed using Java technologies.

## Planned Features

***- JavaFX-based graphical environment
- Fullscreen shell with taskbar and start menu
- Application launcher and simple package integration
- Modular structure for extensions and themes
- Runs as a user-space application on Linux***

JFOS is ideal for experimenting with Java as a system interface layer and building custom lightweight Linux-based experiences.****
